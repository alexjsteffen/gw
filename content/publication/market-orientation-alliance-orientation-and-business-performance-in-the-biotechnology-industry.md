  The purpose of this study was to test the unexplored relationship between
  market orientation (MO), alliance orientation (AO), and business performance
  (PERF) in the medical/healthcare subsector of the Canadian biotechnology
  industry.  The study surveyed Canadian biotechnology executives via mail and
  web-based questionnaires.  It was found that the relationship between MO and
  PERF was positive and significant and the relationship between AO and PERF was
  positive and significant.  It was also found that the relationship between MO
  and AO was positive and significant, supporting the existence of a mediation
  relationship.Â  Specifically, MOAE™s influence on PERF was found to be fully
  mediated by AO.Â  This suggests that Canadian medical/healthcare biotechnology
  companies that were highly market-oriented were also highly alliance-oriented,
  and highly alliance-oriented companies were top performing companies.  This
  study outlines the apparent sequential relationship between market-oriented
  behavioural commitments, alliance-oriented activities, and business
  performance outcomes among Canadian biotechnology companies.  Furthermore, it
  has business development and the commercialization process implications for
  biotechnology managers.
